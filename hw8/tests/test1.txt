For this assignment, you are going to write a program that reads a document containing strings separated by whitespace and counts how often each word appears. You will use this program to compare the performance of two different data structures that you will be creating (Splay Tree vs Hash Table). For this task, a "word" is defined as a string of consecutive non-whitespace characters. Note that, due to this definition, Michael and Michael's are considered different words. There should be no distinction between upper and lower-case, so Michael and michael are considered the same word.

It is strongly suggested that you read the full assignment before you start to program this. A smart way to program this will involve having an abstract class for the ADT that problems 3 and 4 will implement, allowing you to make a minimal change to your program to demonstrate each.

Your target executable for this program must be named zipf and take two command-line arguments: the first indicates whether you're running problem 4 or problem 5 (by accepting an integer; we will only test this program with values 4 and 5, and you are free to do whatever you want for other values), while the second tells you which file you will read from.
